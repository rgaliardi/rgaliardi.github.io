# Hi, I'm Ricardo Galiardi

Data & AI Architect | Full-Stack Data Expert | Technical & Business Leader

I build data organizations. With 10+ years of experience, I work across the entire data value chain—from initial strategy and architecture through production AI implementation. I combine deep technical expertise with genuine business acumen, leading high-performing teams through complex transformation initiatives.

My edge: I speak both languages fluently. Technical depth AND business impact.

## The Data Pillars I Own

### 1. Data Architecture - The Foundation of Everything

I design enterprise-grade data platforms that become the backbone of data-driven organizations. This isn't just about picking cloud tools—it's about understanding your business, your growth trajectory, and what decisions you need to make fast.

**What I Do:**
- Design cloud-native architectures (Azure, Databricks, AWS, GCP) that scale from startup to enterprise
- Modernize legacy systems: moving organizations from monolithic, slow platforms to agile, cloud-first infrastructure
- Implement data mesh patterns: enabling domain-driven teams to own their data while maintaining enterprise governance
- Balance trade-offs: performance vs. cost, flexibility vs. control, innovation vs. stability
- Plan for disaster recovery and high availability because downtime costs money

**Why It Matters to Business:**
- Well-architected platform enables 10x faster analytics, cutting time-to-insight from weeks to hours
- Cloud-native design reduces infrastructure costs by 40-60% vs. legacy systems
- Scalable architecture supports product expansion without rebuilding from scratch
- Governance-first design reduces compliance risk and security incidents

**Key Expertise:** Cloud platforms • Data lake/lakehouse design • Data mesh & governance • High availability • Schema design • Cost optimization

### 2. Data Engineering - The Reliable Delivery Machine

I build the pipelines and infrastructure that turn architectural vision into operational reality. A great architecture without solid engineering is just pretty diagrams. I focus on reliability, performance, and maintainability because data systems run 24/7.

**What I Do:**
- Build ETL/ELT pipelines with Spark that process terabytes daily while maintaining quality
- Implement DBT-driven transformations: version-controlled, tested, documented data models
- Set up Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) so infrastructure changes are reviewed, tested, and reversible
- Design CI/CD pipelines that automate testing, validation, and deployment
- Optimize for cost: a 2-second query optimization across 1000 daily queries saves $100K/year
- Implement observability: knowing when things break before your CEO finds out

**Why It Matters to Business:**
- Reliable pipelines mean reliable business decisions. Broken data equals wrong decisions equals lost revenue
- Well-engineered systems are 10x cheaper to maintain than poorly-built ones
- Automation reduces manual work: engineers spend time on innovation, not firefighting
- Version-controlled infrastructure means rollback in seconds if something breaks
- Data quality checks catch errors before they impact business decisions

**Key Expertise:** Spark/PySpark • DBT • Python/SQL • Infrastructure as Code • CI/CD • API integration • Real-time streaming • Monitoring

### 3. Machine Learning & AI - Turning Models Into Value

ML is not just about building models. It's about identifying problems that models can solve, engineering features that work, and deploying systems that don't break. I help organizations think strategically about where AI creates competitive advantage.

**What I Do:**
- Feature engineering and feature stores: enabling rapid model experimentation
- MLOps infrastructure: model versioning, governance, monitoring in production
- Generative AI applications: RAG systems, LLM integrations, prompt engineering
- AI readiness assessments: identifying high-impact use cases and building roadmaps
- Model governance and explainability: understanding why models make decisions
- Vector databases and embeddings: building semantic search and similarity systems

**Why It Matters to Business:**
- 1% improvement in model accuracy on churn prediction equals millions in retained revenue
- ML systems that fail silently are worse than no ML at all—monitoring and governance prevent this
- Right use cases: churn prediction, demand forecasting, customer segmentation—measurable ROI
- AI governance prevents regulatory risk and builds stakeholder confidence
- Well-engineered ML systems become competitive moats

**Key Expertise:** Feature engineering • MLOps & governance • LLMs & GenAI • RAG systems • Embeddings & vector search • Model evaluation

### 4. Data Science & Analytics - Turning Data Into Insights That Actually Matter

Data science that doesn't drive decisions is just mathematics. I focus on analyses that move the needle: product metrics, growth drivers, customer behavior, financial impact.

**What I Do:**
- Product analytics: instrumenting events, analyzing funnels, cohort analysis, retention metrics
- Marketing analytics: attribution modeling, ROI tracking, CAC vs. LTV analysis
- Statistical analysis: rigorous testing, causal inference, experimental design
- Dashboard design: dashboards that answer questions instead of creating confusion
- Storytelling: presenting findings that executives actually understand and act on

**Why It Matters to Business:**
- Product analytics reveal where users drop off—fix that, conversion increases 30%+
- Marketing analytics show which channels actually drive value (not just clicks)
- Statistical rigor prevents false conclusions that waste resources
- Right metrics drive right behavior. Wrong metrics drive the organization in the wrong direction
- Data-driven culture: when the entire organization trusts the numbers

**Key Expertise:** Product analytics • Marketing analytics & attribution • Statistical analysis • A/B testing • Dashboard design • Business intelligence


### 5. Data Governance & Compliance - Building Trust Into the System

Governance is not just compliance. It's about building organizational trust in data. When people trust the data, they make better decisions faster.

**What I Do:**
- Data governance frameworks: ownership, SLAs, data contracts, documentation
- Data quality: automated testing that catches bad data before it impacts decisions
- Observability and monitoring: knowing the health of your data ecosystem
- Security and privacy: encryption, access controls, masking sensitive data
- Compliance: LGPD, GDPR, industry-specific requirements built in from day one
- Data lineage: tracing where every number comes from

**Why It Matters to Business:**
- Bad data costs time and money. Quality frameworks prevent this systematically
- Regulatory fines: GDPR violations equal 4% of revenue. Compliance is not optional
- Data security breaches destroy customer trust and create existential risk
- Knowing data lineage prevents downstream chaos when something changes
- High-trust data equals faster decisions and fewer arguments about which number to believe

**Key Expertise:** Data governance • Quality & testing • Observability • Security & compliance • Data lineage • LGPD/GDPR

### 6. Business Acumen & Technical Leadership - Connecting Technical Depth to Business Impact

I don't just build technical systems. I help organizations think strategically about how data drives competitive advantage. I mentor engineers while speaking fluently with executives.

**What I Do:**
- Translate business problems into technical architecture
- Build data strategies aligned to business objectives (not just technical elegance)
- ROI-driven prioritization: which 20% of work drives 80% of value?
- Mentor and grow technical teams—my job is to make my team better
- Design decision frameworks: balancing innovation, cost, and risk
- Partner with product and operations: data success requires cross-functional alignment

**Why It Matters to Business:**
- Technical brilliance with no business alignment equals wasted resources
- Data strategy must support business strategy, not exist in isolation
- When engineers understand the business impact of their work, they make better decisions
- Strong technical leadership reduces turnover and builds high-performing teams
- Strategic thinking prevents expensive missteps: building the wrong thing faster is still wrong

**Key Leadership Traits:** Business-first thinking • Cross-functional partnership • Mentorship • Strategic prioritization • Hands-on technical execution
